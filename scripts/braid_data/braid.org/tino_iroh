#  If you're building a native app, you can do anything.
supporting native P2P braid-http in a rust app, is perfectly situated to do some trailblazing work in integrating HTTP/3 over iroh and then adding braid-http support to that HTTP/3 implementation.


# LocalLink. 

Rust p2p Braid http app for information sharing across local and connected networks


Iroh supports p2p QUIC in rust.
It solves the problem of DNS and TLS by doing a pubkey thing and implementing a DHT to route peers together.
It's the best P2P networking system out there. All the P2P projects are switching to iroh right now.
 it runs QUIC, so you can run HTTP/3 over it. There are some 

A new URI scheme would no longer need to rely on DNS and TLS. So it could have P2P hostnames. We would probably need to invent a new URI scheme, but I'm really excited for that.

Exciting possibility: Integrate Braid-HTTP with Iroh
Iroh = modern P2P networking library in Rust
Uses QUIC protocol (supports HTTP/3)
Solves DNS/TLS issues using public keys + DHT for peer routing
Becoming the go-to choice for P2P projects
How HTTP/3 works over QUIC
Iroh documentation and examples (start with that GitHub repo)
URI schemes (how web addresses work - like https:// vs potential new P2P schemes)
DHT (Distributed Hash Tables) - how peers find each other without central servers

How DNS works (to understand what you're replacing)
Public key cryptography (your "address" becomes your public key)
Content addressing vs location addressing
How IPFS, Hypercore, or other P2P systems handle naming
